<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>no optional tags html</title>

<div id="app"></div>
<!-- index.html
Note: order matters! It's often best to load your bundle.js at the end of the html body, so that your DOM content (in this case, the div) has rendered prior to executing the bundle, since we need to access the DOM during rendering.

 <script src="./bundle.js"></script>
